# HSModel

Algorithms for noise model and differential expression analysis of gene expression data with multiple case/controls, for Digital gene Expression (DGE) and RNA-Seq expression data (TPM/FPKM), in experiments in which 
number of replicates are large enough (> 6) to enable gene specific learning of mean and variance of expression.
